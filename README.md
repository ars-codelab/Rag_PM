Project Title: RAG-Powered Conversational AI
============================================

Overview
--------

This repository hosts a comprehensive solution for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, designed to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses based on a curated knowledge base. This repository also contains the supporting code for the article 'The Product Manager's Guide to Enterprise RAG' published at [https://thinkbuildrepeat.substack.com/p/the-product-managers-guide-to-enterprise-rag](https://thinkbuildrepeat.substack.com/p/the-product-managers-guide-to-enterprise-rag). The project integrates a Colab notebook for data processing and model training/fine-tuning, a Streamlit application for an interactive user interface, and dedicated directories for the knowledge files that power the RAG mechanism.


Components
----------

### 1\. Colab Notebooks (colab/)

The colab/ directory contains Jupyter notebooks designed to be run on Google Colab. These notebooks are essential for:

*   **Data Ingestion and Preprocessing:** Scripts to load and clean raw data.
    
*   **Knowledge Base Indexing:** Generating embeddings and creating a searchable index (e.g., FAISS, Annoy) from your knowledge files.
    
*   **Model Fine-tuning (Optional):** If applicable, fine-tuning a pre-trained language model for specific tasks or domains.
    

**Getting Started with Colab:**

1.  Open the .ipynb file(s) in this directory using Google Colab.
    
2.  Follow the instructions within the notebook cells to execute the steps.
    
3.  Ensure you have access to a GPU runtime in Colab for faster processing.
    

### 2\. Streamlit Application (streamlit\_app/)

The streamlit\_app/ directory holds the Python code for the interactive web application built with Streamlit. This application serves as the user interface where users can interact with the RAG system, submit queries, and receive answers grounded in the provided knowledge.

**Running the Streamlit App Locally:**

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
    
2.  pip install -r streamlit\_app/requirements.txt(Note: You might need to create requirements.txt based on the libraries used in your Streamlit app).
    
3.  cd streamlit\_app/
    
4.  streamlit run app.py # Or whatever your main Streamlit file is namedThis will open the application in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.
    

### 3\. Knowledge Files (Files/)

This directory is where all the source documents and data that form your knowledge base are stored. These files are typically processed by the Colab notebooks to create the RAG index. Examples include:
    

**Adding New Knowledge:**

To extend the RAG system's knowledge, simply add new relevant documents to this directory and then re-run the appropriate Colab notebook(s) to re-index the knowledge base.
